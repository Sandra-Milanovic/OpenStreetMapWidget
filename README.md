OpenStreetMapWidget
===============

This project aims to create a widget builder for OpenStreetMap. Users of the widget builder will be able to create the following types of widgets:

 * A simple single-location (iframe-embeddable) map with the ability to get directions
 * A route map which shows a predefined route
 * An advanced map with multiple waypoints, polygons and routes
